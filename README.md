Installation: npm install

Get free api key from https://newsapi.org/ and add that in .env file or replace inside the App.js component.

A fully responsive and real time project. I have not deployed this project because of the api I was using. It will not fetch data if the deployment is done. You can go throught the code or can can download the code and add your own api key and run the code on your machine.

Used technologies, packages and libraries: React, Bootstrap, react-router-dom, react-infinite-scroll-component, react-top-loading-bar.
